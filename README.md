# Sprint points calculator

<!--
How to think about if the average number of points doesn't have the same number of devs?
Maybe should be multiple questions first: how many weeks is the sprint, how many devs, how many days off, what's the average points, how many devs scored that average, how long was that sprint
Maybe secondary options should be extra settings hidden behind a toggle
Error states: positive number only allowed, show error message if not
How to fix the uncontrolled input issue?
How to reset the input cache on loading

What other improvements that came overnight I forgot???
React spring with the card coming in from the top or left, so it becomes like a Typeform form
Add tests
Use Formik?
Weight days off: 25 days off * 10 devs / how many working days in 1 year
