# Sprint points calculator

  // How to think about if the average number of points doesn't have the same number of devs?

  // Maybe should be multiple questions first: how many weeks is the sprint, how many devs, how many days off, what's the average points, how many devs scored that average, how long was that sprint
  // Maybe secondary options should be extra settings hidden behind a toggle

  // Error states: positive number only allowed, show error message if not
  // How to fix uncontrolled input issue ?
  // How reset input cache on loading

  // Add styling
  // Use styled-component

  // Clean and separate code
  // Deploy to pointscalculator.app

  // What other improvements that came overnight I forgot???

  // React spring with the card coming in from the top or left so it becomes like a Typeform form
