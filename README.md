# Sprint points calculator

<!--
How to think about if the average number of points doesn't have the same number of devs?
Maybe should be multiple questions first: how many weeks is the sprint, how many devs, how many days off, what's the average points, how many devs scored that average, how long was that sprint
Maybe secondary options should be extra settings hidden behind a toggle
Error states: positive number only allowed, show error message if not
How to fix the uncontrolled input issue?
How to reset the input cache on loading
Add styling
Use styled-component
Clean and separate code
Check gridvote repo
Deploy to pointscalculator.app
What other improvements that came overnight I forgot???
React spring with the card coming in from the top or left, so it becomes like a Typeform form
Add tests
Use Formik?
Weight days off: 25 days off * 10 devs / how many working days in 1 year

Show error message if click on next and field is empty
Show error if in fields there are not just positive numbers

Design should be gradients from first screen to last and change at every refresh
White block with content and background around

For average points per sprint should pre populate numbers of devs and give possibility to edit

Releases plan: 
0.1 current
0.2 all the questions, simple design and weight days off
0.3 pre populate number of devs for average points steps
0.4 error states
0.5 clean code and fix issues
0.6 one step per screen and new design
0.7 can't go to next step if empty field
0.8 prepare repo
0.9 clean code
1.0 add tests
